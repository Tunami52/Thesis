\begin{abstract}
  In 1972 Hajnal and Kertész published a paper proving that the Axiom of Choice is equivalent to the assertion that a groupoid structure can be defined on every set.
  This thesis aims to provide the necessary background needed for this proof.
  In the first part basic concepts in set theory such as the Well-Ordering Theorem are derived. 
  This culminates in a lemma by Hartogs (1915) in which it is shown, without the Axiom of Choice, that for every set there exists an ordinal with cardinality greater than that of the set.
  The second part then gives an introduction to model theory with the aim to prove the Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem.
  This theorem states that every theory with an infinite model also has infinite models of any given power.
  The final part of the thesis then examines the proof from Hajnal's and Kertész's paper in detail.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank Anitha Thillaisundaram for being my thesis advisor and for all the helpful suggestions and feedback she provided.

I would like to thank my family as well as my friends both in Lund and in Frankfurt. 
I appreciate the patience and support you gave me during the entire writing process.
I would also like to extend my thanks the regulars of the mathematics student council (MUR) room, where large parts of this thesis were conceptualized and written.
You were there whenever I needed to explain something in order to understand it myself.

Lastly I would like to thank Tomas Persson for taking the time to be my examiner.
