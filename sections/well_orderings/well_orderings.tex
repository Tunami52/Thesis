\subsection*{Hartogs' Lemma}
We continue with the final result for this chapter, 
a lemma originally stated by Hartogs in 1915, restated in this form in our main paper \cite{Haj72}.

\begin{lemma}\cite{Har15}
    Let $A$ be an arbitrary set.
    Then there exists an ordinal $\alpha$, 
    %such that no subset of $A$ can be injectively mapped on to $\alpha$.
    such that no injective map from any subset of $A$ to $\alpha$ exists.
\end{lemma}
